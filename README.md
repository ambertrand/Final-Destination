# Description
 Have you ever gone shopping for someone and forgot something?  We definitely have!  Now with Covid-19 it is more important than ever to remember shopping items in one trip.  Which is exactly what brought us to the idea for While You're There.

 Our application allows a user to log in or create an account, create a group as well as view their groups and most importantly alert other group members that they are going shopping at a particular store.  The other group members can then add items to the shoppers list in real time so that the shopper can get all the needed items in one trip!
